<h2>What if the thing I want doesn't exist on NPM?</h2>

<h3>I had this problem</h3>

<ul>
    <li>I wanted to use my 3D sensing camera</li>
    <li>Only older versions existed on NPM</li>
    <li>I had a C++ library</li>
    <li>I wanted a better solution than CLI</li>
</ul>
<br/>        <br/>
<h3>No problem!</h3>

<small>(Well OK - it was kinda hard)</small>
